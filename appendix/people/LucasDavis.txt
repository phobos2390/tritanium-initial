Lucas Davis was a young German boy of 13 (in Martian years, 25 Earth Years). He was from an area of Mars under French control that had been ceded from Germany after they lost a war several years ago. Lucas is an inquisitive boy who is primarily interested in ChemicaL Engineering and enjoys studying agriculture primarily. He does agriculture in his spare time, engaging with it on Mars by purchasing a hydroponics lab as well as an underground garden. While on Ceres, he joined a company group that worked with agriculture and he got quite good at it. One of the crops he grew was peppers. Because Capsaicin is present in peppers, he had studied up on its chemistry. His job on Ceres was chiefly studying the designs of the processing facilities and figuring out their bottlenecks. Ceres' ore was a carbonaceous material that contained several different minerals. Some of those minerals were the main ingredients in the industrial fertilizers used on Mars. One of the machines extracted ammonia out of the ores. Another extracted sulfur compounds. The ammonia extractor was Lucas' division. From ammonia, several machines did different things with it.
