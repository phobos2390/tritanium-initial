EXTERIOR: SPACE SHIP IN ORBIT AROUND AN ASTEROID.


An establishing shot of the ship above the asteroid Vesta. No sound is heard.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


The captain stands hunched, hand on the wall, leaning forward, peering into a screen that one of his subordinates is manning. A tense silence until a voice comes on the communication channel.


VOICE: Looks like the turret got stuck on the starboard side of the wall.


CAPTAIN: How long will it take to fix?


VOICE: About ten minutes.


(CAPTAIN rubs his forehead)


CAPTAIN: Ok, report back to me when you’re finished.


VOICE: Affirmative.


CAPTAIN: (to SUBORDINATE) Get me the landing team. (SUBORDINATE switches some buttons) What’s your progress?


2ND VOICE: We’re just outside the perimeter of the restricted area.


CAPTAIN: Don’t go in until I give the signal.


2ND VOICE: Affirmative, Captain.


CAPTAIN: (to SUBORDINATE) Signal me if you see a blip on the radar. (CAPTAIN moves to go)


SUBORDINATE: Sir (grabs the CAPTAIN’S arm. The two stare ate each other. After a pause, the CAPTAIN breaks the stare and moves towards the FIRST OFFICER)


CAPTAIN: Meet me in my meeting room.


INTERIOR: CAPTAIN’S MEETING ROOM


The CAPTAIN and the FIRST OFFICER are sitting across from each other on the table. The SECOND OFFICER stands to the side of both of them.


CAPTAIN: We are still waiting for the situation with the turret to be fixed. The landing party is just outside the Jupiterian area. I’ve told the landing party to wait until my signal to head in. What’s the situation with the other vessels?


FIRST OFFICER: The Valles Marineris has encountered no trouble and is going to rendezvous with us in a half hour. The Elysium is making a course correction but has managed to place all of its orbital turrets and will rendezvous with us within the hour.


INTERIOR: RADAR SCREEN


The radar screen shows the scan line rotating around, finding nothing. It rotates twice.


INTERIOR: CAPTAIN’S MEETING ROOM (cont.)


SECOND OFFICER: Let’s get down to the point. She sits down in her chair. What are we going to do when the Jupiterians get here?


CAPTAIN: I’m going to do whatever I can to negotiate a peace with them.


FIRST OFFICER: (incredulous) What?


CAPTAIN: I don’t want war with the JMC.


FIRST OFFICER: Sir, with all due respect, the Jupiterians are the aggressors here. It is they who took over our-


CAPTAIN: (interrupting) I still don’t want war with them.


FIRST OFFICER: (speaking at the same time)-facilities illegally. (speaking on his own) They are a menace.


CAPTAIN: (raises voice) I don’t care if they are a menace. I don’t want war with them.


FIRST OFFICER: (getting angry) It’s because you are German. Isn’t it?


CAPTAIN: That has nothing to do with it.


FIRST OFFICER: (sarcastic) Oh, yeah, of course it has nothing to do with it. (serious) Your people sicken me. You’d betray your own planet-


CAPTAIN: (interrupting and getting angry as well) That is out of line!


FIRST OFFICER: (continuing) -to the Jupiterians. All you care about is your stupid land. You lost that land fair and square.


CAPTAIN: (outraged) This is outrageous!
FIRST OFFICER: Why? Because it’s true?


CAPTAIN: I told you that my decision to negotiate a peace treaty has nothing to do with my country. I might as well say that because you’re French-


FIRST OFFICER: (interrupting) What? That I can see your real motivations?


CAPTAIN: That you are someone who will find any excuse to go to war with anyone else. You don’t care about the consequences of your actions. All you care about is satiating your blood thirst!


SECOND OFFICER: (shouting) Gentlemen! This discussion is not becoming of a captain and his first officer. 


FIRST OFFICER: I did not ask for this assignment! This is no captain of mine!


SECOND OFFICER: It does not matter! We were assigned this job by the Martian Planetary Government! No matter your personal feelings on this matter, sir, the captain outranks you and you will give him the respect he deserves. We are here to do a job. (The room calms down). However, (turns to CAPTAIN) I do agree with the first officer. The Jupiterians are a military threat to Mars and her allies.


CAPTAIN: Yes, they do pose a threat. However, I do not want to just jump into this conflict with halfcocked. When the Jupiterians get here, I will do as much as I can without resorting to violence.


FIRST OFFICER: But if you wait too long, they’ll likely have a military edge. Any semblance of preparedness we have will be lost.


CAPTAIN: So? If we can negotiate a peaceful-


FIRST OFFICER: (interrupting) But if-


CAPTAIN: (plowing through) Transition, we-


FIRST OFFICER: (interrupting) will show that whenever Jupiter makes a show of force, Mars scampers away, scared.


CAPTAIN: (ignoring) will avoid a useless and groundless war against a government which we have no need to quarrel with!


FIRST OFFICER: The Jupiterians are our largest solar political threat! If we don’t act as soon as we can, the JMC will have a bigger military! Strike now while there’s still time!


CAPTAIN: That’s conjecture!


Another shouting match begins. This time, it’s inaudible


INTERIOR: RADAR SCREEN


Zoom in to the radar screen. The sounds of the argument are heard. The scan line rotates once, twice, and on the third time, there’s an audible blip.


EXTERIOR: VIEWSCREEN’S VIEW


A slow moving speck of light moves towards the camera ever so slightly. Eerie and ominous music starts.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S CONTROL CENTER


SUBORDINATE, who was staring intensely at the screen, leans back, a panicked look in his eye. Looking around, he sees CREWMATE, he motions him to come over. CREWMATE walks over. SUBORDINATE points at the screen. CREWMATE nods his head in recognition.


SUBORDINATE: Get the captain!


CREWMATE: Aye. (walks toward the door)


INTERIOR: CAPTAIN’S MEETING ROOM


Heated inaudible argument heard as CREWMATE enters the room. Both CAPTAIN and FIRST OFFICER are standing. SECOND OFFICER sits in the back, head in her hands.


CREWMATE: (not heard over din) Um, excuse me captain?


CAPTAIN: (shouting) You would have Mars wage war at the drop of a hat!


CREWMATE: (louder) Um, excuse me-


FIRST OFFICER: (interrupting) And you want to see Mars fall!


SECOND OFFICER glances up and sees CREWMATE. She stands up.


CAPTAIN: (still oblivious) At least I care about its people! You-


SECOND OFFICER: (interrupting) Gentlemen! News!


CAPTAIN and FIRST OFFICER turn around to see CREWMATE standing there.


CREWMATE: The Jupiterians have just come into sensor range.


All four exit the room.
INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


CAPTAIN follows CREWMATE over to console. CAPTAIN leans in again to see the scan line go across the dot. Another blip. On the screen, the dot inches closer to the middle.


CAPTAIN: (to SUBORDINATE) Get me the status on the turret. (SUBORDINATE pushes some buttons) What’s the status on the turret?


VOICE: Another couple of minutes.


CAPTAIN: Any way to get it to go faster?


VOICE: No.


CAPTAIN: (shouting) That’s not good enough! 


Everyone jumps. CAPTAIN Sighs and rubs his forehead


CAPTAIN: Sorry, do your best. How much longer?


VOICE: About three more minutes.


CAPTAIN: Ok, just know that the Jupiterians have entered within sensor range.


VOICE: Ok. We’ll let you know when we’re done.


(SUBORDINATE turns off communication)


CAPTAIN: (to rest of the crew) Sorry about that, I let my temper get the better of me.


SECOND OFFICER: It doesn’t matter, we’re all on edge. Let’s get back to work.


CAPTAIN: One other thing. (to SUBORDINATE) What’s the ETA for the Jupiterians?


SUBORDINATE: They should be here in within the hour.


CAPTAIN: What’s the situation with the Marineris?


FIRST OFFICER: They should be here within a half hour.


CAPTAIN: How many orbital turrets have we deployed?


SECOND OFFICER: Thirteen, sir.


CAPTAIN: (to SUBORDINATE) When will we be able to make out our enemies armaments?


SUBORDINATE: Difficult to say, sir. 1000 km is our sensor range. We should be able to tell when they get within about 500 km, but that’s pushing it. We’ll definitely be able to tell when they get within 100 km.


CAPTAIN: Any clues as to how many ships there will be?


SUBORDINATE: Hard to tell. They might be coming in at a very tight formation, within 1 km of each other, or they might be coming in staggered or scattered.


CAPTAIN: Fine, then, keep me posted. (to FIRST OFFICER and SECOND OFFICER) In my meeting room.


INTERIOR: CAPTAIN’S MEETING ROOM


FIRST OFFICER: You should give the order to attack right now.


CAPTAIN: Like I said earlier, I don’t want to declare war with Jupiter.


FIRST OFFICER: The Jupiterians won’t see it coming.


CAPTAIN: We are not at war yet and I will not just blindly jump into a war again. I don’t want to make us the aggressors here.


FIRST OFFICER: We won’t get this good of a chance again. If we manage to hone in on their location, we can stop them cold right now.


CAPTAIN: We can’t just start firing on that ship. We’d lose all of our support with the Government of Titan, and lose a lot of our support with the Lunarian Confederacy.


FIRST OFFICER: They’d support our action.


CAPTAIN: It would be a wanton act of aggression. They haven’t picked sides yet. For all we know, if we show that we are the ones willing to instigate a war such as this, they’ll wind up on the Jupiterian side, especially the Government of Titan. 


FIRST OFFICER falls silent


CAPTAIN: Now, I know that you have no confidence in my desire to get Mars involved in a war like this, but it’s because I don’t want to have to waste Martian lives, even if they be French, on the possibility of the JMC becoming a threat.


FIRST OFFICER: We would waste even more lives if we were to wait until the Jupiterians had more time to build up their armed forces!


CAPTAIN: So what if the Jupiterians become more powerful militarily than us? What have they got against us?
FIRST OFFICER: They’re Jupiterians!


CAPTAIN: That’s not good enough!


INTERIOR: RADAR SCREEN


The dot is about a quarter of the way across the screen.


INTERIOR: CAPTAIN’S MEETING ROOM


There is evidence that some time has passed. CREWMATE walks in and everyone else turns to look at him.


CREWMATE: Turret’s free sir.


CAPTAIN: (lighting up with a noticeable sign of relief on his face) Good.


CREWMATE exits followed by the other three.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


Again, CAPTAIN moves over to SUBORDINATE, who pushes some buttons on his console.


CAPTAIN: What’s your status?


VOICE: We’ve got the turret unstuck. Doesn’t look like it will be very useful to us though.


CAPTAIN: Will we be able to place more turrets?


VOICE: Yes, sir.


CAPTAIN: How likely is it that another turret will get stuck?


VOICE: Not likely.


CAPTAIN: Ok, we’ll move to another drop off orbit.


EXTERIOR: VIEWSCREEN’S VIEW


The Jupiterian ship is now noticeably closer.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


There is more evidence that some time has passed. CAPTAIN is sitting in his chair, rubbing his chin. FIRST OFFICER is hunched over another console. SUBORDINATE turns around and motions for CAPTAIN to come over. He gets up from off his chair and goes to SUBORDINATE.
SUBORDINATE: We’re in position.


CAPTAIN: All, right. Release the turret.


SUBORDINATE: (to console) Release the turret.


EXTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S HOLDING BAY


Shot of the turret being pushed out into space.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


SUBORDINATE: Turret released, sir.


CAPTAIN: Good work. Notify me again when we’re in our next position.


INTERIOR: RADAR SCREEN


The dot is now halfway across the screen.


INTERIOR: SPACE SHIP’S COMMAND CENTER


CAPTAIN: Can we get a reading on their armaments?


SUBORDINATE: It looks like the Jupiterians are just close enough.


CAPTAIN: How many ships are in their fleet?


SUBORDINATE looks at his console. His face suddenly becomes horrified.


SUBORDINATE: Seven, sir.


Everyone pauses.


CAPTAIN: Seven?


SUBORDINATE: Yes, seven.


CAPTAIN: What are their armaments?


SUBORDINATE: It looks as though their leading ship has several ship mounted guns. It doesn’t look like it has as many guns as ours does though.


CAPTAIN: Let me see. (peers at console) Let’s see (rubs his forehead, turns to FIRST OFFICER) How far away is the Marineris?


FIRST OFFICER: They’re very close.


CAPTAIN: Let me talk to them (walks over to FIRST OFFICER. 2ND CREWMATE pushes several buttons) Olympus to Marineris, do you copy?


MARINERIS: Marineris here. What’s your status?


CAPTAIN: I don’t know how much you know, but the Jupiterians have a fleet of seven.


MARINERIS: Seven? How far away is the Elysium?


CAPTAIN glances at console.


CAPTAIN: About half an hour away.


MARINERIS: So that’s our three to their seven, huh?


CAPTAIN: Yep


MARINERIS: Well, those Jupiterians sure do mean business, don’t they?


CAPTAIN: How long until you rendezvous with us?


MARINERIS: A couple of minutes.


CAPTAIN: Good. We need to consolidate our forces.


MARINERIS: What’s the situation down on Vesta?


CAPTAIN shows faint surprise.


MARINERIS: Have you contacted the landing team yet?


CAPTAIN: No. (rubs his forehead) We’ll contact them right away. (to SUBORDINATE) Get me the landing team.


SUBORDINATE: Aye, sir! (to console) What’s your status?


2ND VOICE: (static)


SUBORDINATE: (slightly alarmed) Olympus to landing team, what’s your status?


INTERIOR: LANDING TEAM


Camera shows the landing team dead. The communication device sounds out as SUBORDINATE’S voice is heard.
